            Hi, my name is James Mcgill and I am a new software engineer. I have recently graduated from Western
            Governors University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
            Through, my time at WGU, and my experiences prior to starting, I have a resevoir of experiences to pull from
            when writing clean and efficient code. Some of my skills and knowledge areas, to list a few,
            include: Docker, Spring Boot, Angular, Machine Learning, Quality Assurance, Algorithms, and Data Management.
            I have worked on several projects and documents and below I have listed some of my most memorable.

                    The Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS) needs to determine an efficient route and
                    delivery distribution for their daily local deliveries (DLD) because packages are not currently
                    being consistently delivered by their promised deadline. The Salt Lake City DLD route has three
                    trucks, two drivers, and an average of 40 packages to deliver each day. Each package has specific
                    criteria and delivery requirements that are listed.

                    <br />
                    This was one of my first algorithms projects, and thus completing it challenged me. In order to
                    solve this problem, I created a
                    linked list to store all locations and packages. Each location had access to all neighbor location,
                    and had a customer add location method
                    that used insertion sort to automatically sort the list each time a node was added, that way the
                    neighbor locations would always be listed
                    closest to farthest. <br /> I then used a modified nearest neighbor algorithm to create the
                    solution. The algorithm search each nearest neighbor and checked
                    if it had already been delivered to. When the algorithm found an available neighbor, it added all
                    packages from that neighbor to an appropriate truck
                    based on any special conditions or requirements.

                    You are hired as a contractor to help a university migrate an existing student system to a new
                    platform using C language. Since the application already exists, its requirements exist as well,
                    and they are outlined in the next section. You are responsible for implementing the part of the
                    system based on these requirements. A list of data is provided as part of these requirements. This
                    part of the system is responsible for reading and manipulating the provided data.

                    This was my first experience with C, and it definitely has a learning curve. I had a lot of prior
                    experience with java and other OO Languages,
                    but the pointers in C definitely made things difficult. This is why I included this more simply
                    project in my list, this was a memorable and challenging project
                    as I slowly learned the power behind C.<br />
                    This project used regular expressions to parse data and clean it into usable strings that were then
                    used to create a student object. The students
                    were then added to a roster. The roster was used for validation or emails, student Ids, and
                    calculating average gpa.

                    You are working for a company that licenses and customizes a software application to keep track of
                    inventory in stores. Your job as a software developer is to customize this application to meet a
                    specific customer’s needs. You will choose any type of customer you would like, but it must sell a
                    product composed of parts. An example of products versus parts would be a customer that’s a bicycle
                    shop: a bicycle is a product, and a set of two matching wheels is a part

                    One of the biggest questions I had always had was, "How do things like php or java work with html?"
                    This project
                    was my first answer. <br />
                    In this project, I used simple spring boot controllers, entities, CRUD repositories, services, and
                    validations to create the backend for a simple GUI.
                    The project used thymeleaf to display the front end, so at this point there was not any RESTful
                    services, but it was a great introduction to persistence.

                    A travel agency has recently launched a complete overhaul of their front-end vacation bookings
                    application using Angular and JavaScript. Lately, the front-end engineers have encountered various
                    undocumented bugs when sending requests and fetching data from the back-end. Since the back-end was
                    built in the early 1990s and the original developer has since retired and can no longer help
                    troubleshoot, the existing team is concerned about the growing tech debt and lack of ongoing
                    support. Your chief technology officer (CTO) decided to create a project to port over any
                    mission-critical functionalities to a modern framework and has selected you, a software developer in
                    Java, to start developing the minimally viable product (MVP) to migrate the legacy back-end to the
                    modern Spring framework.

                    This is my first project where all the code was my own. I wrote the angular front end (using
                    typescript, html, and css), the spring boot backend, and constructed
                    the MySQL database for persistence. This project, though not heavy on logic, was the first time I
                    developed a application and required a lot of planning. I had several
                    entities (Vacation, Excursion, Customer, Cart, CartItem, ect.) each with varying relationships to
                    the other entities. This project is where I really learned the importance
                    of design. For example, I had to create detailed UML and ERD to keep my backend organized and I had
                    to use the UML to create the database tables.

                    One of the more important concepts in optimization is multithreading. This project had requirements
                    of meeting scheduling, displaying prices in different currencies,
                    and detecting time zones to change currency. This project still implemented angular and spring boot,
                    but it also used java multithreading to determine time zones and
                    perform localization. Another thread was used to determine meeting times based on location. This was
                    not a super demanding project, but it ensured that I was confortable
                    with localization, Internationalization, and multithreading.

                    This problem was very exciting and intimidating, this was one of my first real-world problem I
                    solved using machine learning. Previously, I had used things

                        href="https://home.pandorabots.com/home.html" target="_blank">pandorabots</a> to create
                    machine learning tools. However, this used python do several things: Load data from a database,
                    clean the raw data, plot the data on several different graphs, and use a ordinary
                    least squares algorithm to draw a line of regression and use that line to make predictions.

                    This project was one of my first introductions to MySQL and postgresSQL, I will admit I found it
                    very frustrating. I used MySQL scripts to do several things, and to query
                    hundreds of rows of provided data. I was unable for a while to figure out
                    how to properly join table from several different tables together. Eventually, I figured it out. I
                    came up with a solution by creating my own crude version of a
                    ERD without knowing what I was creating.

                            financial data since the business was started. Then, it will request future forecasts until

                    This project was one of a sequence of proposals/QA plans I wroted. This QA plan was connected to a previously written proposal for the software solution.
                    The functional requirements, listed above, were needing to be tested as well as non-functional in-scope requirements I listed in the proposal. This assignment
                    was the last one in the sequence, and I listed it because it really help me to understand just how important testing is and that, the test plan needs to be as 
                    good as possible, because bugs are going to happen anyways after deployment, but you should try to remove as many as possible.
